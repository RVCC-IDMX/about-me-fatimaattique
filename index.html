        <h2>Biography:</h2>

        <div>
            <p>Hello, I've been in the U.S. for five years. Learning English and adapting to a new culture was tough, but now I'm about to finish my Associate's in Information and Systems Technology at RVCC. Next, I plan to transfer to either Rutgers or Kean University.

                My goal? I want to dive into Information Technology Management, making a difference in how organizations use tech. Plus, I'm keen on cybersecurity, aiming to play a role in keeping digital spaces safe.
                
                It's been a journey of growth, and I'm excited about what the future holds. As I wrap up at RVCC, I look forward to taking my skills into the real world and continuing my education at a new university. Let's see where this IT adventure takes me!

        <h2>The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes</h2>

        <div> 

           <p>And now I have a very strange experience to tell you. I had, as you know, cut off my hair in London, and I had placed it in a great coil at the bottom of my trunk. One evening, after the child was in bed, I began to amuse myself by examining the furniture of my room and by rearranging my own little things. There was an old chest of drawers in the room, the two upper ones empty and open, the lower one locked. I had filled the first two with my linen, and as I had still much to pack away I was naturally annoyed at not having the use of the third drawer. It struck me that it might have been fastened by a mere oversight, so I took out my bunch of keys and tried to open it. The very first key fitted to perfection, and I drew the drawer open. There was only one thing in it, but I am sure that you would never guess what it was. It was my coil of hair.</p>

           <p>"I took it up and examined it. It was of the same peculiar tint, and the same thickness. But then the impossibility of the thing obtruded itself upon me. How could my hair have been locked in the drawer? With trembling hands I undid my trunk, turned out the contents, and drew from the bottom my own hair. I laid the two tresses together, and I assure you that they were identical. Was it not extraordinary? Puzzle as I would, I could make nothing at all of what it meant. I returned the strange hair to the drawer, and I said nothing of the matter to the Rucastles as I felt that I had put myself in the wrong by opening a drawer which they had locked.</p>

           <p>"I am naturally observant, as you may have remarked, Mr. Holmes, and I soon had a pretty good plan of the whole house in my head. There was one wing, however, which appeared not to be inhabited at all. A door which faced that which led into the quarters of the Tollers opened into this suite, but it was invariably locked. One day, however, as I ascended the stair, I met Mr. Rucastle coming out through this door, his keys in his hand, and a look on his face which made him a very different person to the round, jovial man to whom I was accustomed. His cheeks were red, his brow was all crinkled with anger, and the veins stood out at his temples with passion. He locked the door and hurried past me without a word or a look.</p>

           <p>"This aroused my curiosity, so when I went out for a walk in the grounds with my charge, I strolled round to the side from which I could see the windows of this part of the house. There were four of them in a row, three of which were simply dirty, while the fourth was shuttered up. They were evidently all deserted. As I strolled up and down, glancing at them occasionally, Mr. Rucastle came out to me, looking as merry and jovial as ever.</p>

           <p>"'Ah!' said he, 'you must not think me rude if I passed you without a word, my dear young lady. I was preoccupied with business matters.'</p>

              <h2>Understanding CSS Animation</h2>
          
              <p>CSS animation allows developers to bring elements on a webpage to life by smoothly transitioning between different styles. This adds a layer of interactivity and visual appeal, enhancing the overall user experience. Let's explore some key aspects of CSS animation.</p>
          
              <h3>Key Concepts:</h3>
          
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>@keyframes Rule:</strong>
                  At the core of CSS animation is the <code>@keyframes</code> rule, which allows developers to define animations using a set of keyframes. Each keyframe specifies the style at a particular point in the animation.
                </li>
          
                <li>
                  <strong>Animation Properties:</strong>
                  <ul>
                    <li><code>animation-name</code>: Specifies the name of the <code>@keyframes</code> rule.</li>
                    <li><code>animation-duration</code>: Defines the duration of the animation.</li>
                    <li><code>animation-timing-function</code>: Sets the pace of the animation (e.g., ease-in, ease-out).</li>
                    <li><code>animation-iteration-count</code>: Determines how many times the animation should repeat.</li>
                  </ul>
                </li>
              </ol>
